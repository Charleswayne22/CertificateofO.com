Where Can I Get a Certificate of Ownership in Nigeria?

This document establishes ownership rights over land or property in Nigeria. The government issues it to individuals, businesses, or organisations to certify their right to occupy and use a parcel of land. 

The importance of obtaining this document cannot be overstated, as it protects landowners from disputes, encroachments, and other legal issues. 

If you are looking to acquire a Certificate of Ownership in Nigeria, this guide will walk you through the process, the requirements, and where you can obtain it.

Why Certificate of Ownership is Important in Nigeria
Before diving into where you can obtain a Certificate of Ownership, it is important you understand more what this document represents and why it is necessary. 

In Nigeria, land ownership is governed by the Land Use Act of 1978, which vests all land in each state in the hands of the governor. As a result, landowners must obtain permission from the state government to officially occupy and use the land.

The Certificate of Ownership is the official document that gives the holder the legal right to possess and use a specific piece of land. Without this certificate, the ownership of land may be questioned, leading to potential legal challenges. 

A Certificate of Ownership also serves as proof of title, making it easier for the landowner to transfer, sell, or lease the land in the future.

Obtaining a Certificate of Ownership is essential for several reasons:

Legal Protection: With a Certificate of Ownership, you have legal proof of your right to occupy and use the land. This protects you from potential disputes with other parties who may lay claim to the land.
Financial Security: Banks and financial institutions often require a Certificate of Ownership before approving loans or mortgages for property development. This document provides financial security as it proves you are the legitimate owner of the property.
Resale Value: A property with a valid Certificate of Ownership is more valuable in the real estate market. Buyers and investors are more likely to purchase property that is legally documented.
Avoid Encroachment: Without a Certificate of Ownership, your land may be vulnerable to encroachment or illegal occupation by others. The certificate provides a legal basis to contest any such actions.
Steps to Obtain a Certificate of Ownership in Nigeria
Acquiring a Certificate of Ownership in Nigeria involves several steps, which may vary depending on the state. However, the general procedure includes the following:

Survey the Land: The first step in obtaining a Certificate of Ownership is to have the land surveyed by a licensed surveyor. The surveyor will create a detailed plan of the land, indicating its boundaries and dimensions. This survey plan is a critical document that must be submitted with your application for a Certificate of Ownership.
Submit an Application: Once you have the survey plan, you will need to submit an application to the relevant land administration authority in your state. This is usually the Ministry of Lands or the Governorâ€™s office. The application will require you to provide personal details, information about the land, and supporting documents, including the survey plan.
Conduct a Title Search: Before issuing a Certificate of Ownership, the government will conduct a title search to verify that the land is not subject to any existing claims or disputes. This process ensures that there are no conflicting ownership claims or legal issues associated with the land.
Pay the Required Fees: There are several fees associated with obtaining a Certificate of Ownership, including application fees, survey fees, and processing fees. The exact amount varies depending on the state and the size of the land.
Inspection of the Land: In some cases, officials from the land administration office may inspect the land to verify the information provided in your application. This inspection helps confirm that the land is suitable for the intended use.
Approval and Issuance: If the application is successful, the governor or the relevant authority will approve the issuance of the Certificate of Ownership. You will receive an official document certifying your ownership of the land.
